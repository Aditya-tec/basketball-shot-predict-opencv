# Basketball Prediction using OpenCV

This Python script utilizes the OpenCV library to perform basketball prediction based on the trajectory of the ball in a given video.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- cvzone

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the script.

2. Make sure you have the required video file (replace `'Videos/vid (4).mp4'` with the path to your video file).

```python
# start
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('Videos/vid (4).mp4')
```

## Color Finder Configuration

The script uses the `ColorFinder` class from `cvzone` to identify the color of the basketball in the video. You can adjust the HSV values accordingly in the `hsvVals` dictionary for better color detection.

```python
# color finder
myColorFinder = ColorFinder(False)
hsvVals = {'hmin': 8, 'smin': 96, 'vmin': 115, 'hmax': 14, 'smax': 255, 'vmax': 255}
```

## Running the Script

Simply run the script, and it will process the video, identify the basketball, and predict its trajectory.

```bash
python basketball_prediction.py
```

## Results

The script will display the processed video with the predicted trajectory. If the ball's trajectory is within a specific range, it will print "KOBE!!!"; otherwise, it will print "HELL NA".

## Notes

- Make sure to have the video file in the specified path.
- Adjust the HSV values for better color detection.
- The prediction is based on the quadratic trajectory of the basketball.
